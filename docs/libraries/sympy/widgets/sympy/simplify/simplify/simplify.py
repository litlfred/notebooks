SymPy simplify Widget
Simplifies the given expression. Explanation Simplification is not a well defined term and the exact strategies this function tries can change in the future versions of SymPy. If your algorithm relies on "simplification" (whatever it is), try to determine what you need exactly  -  is it powsimp()?, radsimp()?, together()?, logcombine()?, or something else? And use this particular function directly, because those are well defined and thus your algorithm will be robust. Nonetheless, especially for interactive use, or when you do not know anything about the structure of the expression, simplify() tries to apply intelligent heuristics to make the input expression "simpler".  For example: >>> from sympy import simplify, cos, sin >>> from sympy.abc import x, y >>> a = (x + x**2)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2) >>> a (x**2 + x)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2) >>> simplify(a) x + 1 Note that we could have obtained the same result by using specific simplification functions: >>> from sympy import trigsimp, cancel >>> trigsimp(a) (x**2 + x)/x >>> cancel(_) x + 1 In some cases, applying :func:`simplify` may actually result in some more complicated expression. The default ``ratio=1.7`` prevents more extreme cases: if (result length)/(input length) > ratio, then input is returned unmodified.  The ``measure`` parameter lets you specify the function used to determine how complex an expression is.  The function should take a single argument as an expression and return a number such that if expression ``a`` is more complex than expression ``b``, then ``measure(a) > measure(b)``.  The default measure function is :func:`~.count_ops`, which returns the total number of operations in the expression. For example, if ``ratio=1``, ``simplify`` output cannot be longer than input. :: >>> from sympy import sqrt, simplify, count_ops, oo >>> root = 1/(sqrt(2)+3) Since ``simplify(root)`` would result in a slightly longer expression, root is returned unchanged instead:: >>> simplify(root, ratio=1) == root True If ``ratio=oo``, simplify will be applied anyway:: >>> count_ops(simplify(root, ratio=oo)) > count_ops(root) True Note that the shortest expression is not necessary the simplest, so setting ``ratio`` to 1 may not be a good idea. Heuristically, the default value ``ratio=1.7`` seems like a reasonable choice. You can easily define your own measure function based on what you feel should represent the "size" or "complexity" of the input expression.  Note that some choices, such as ``lambda expr: len(str(expr))`` may appear to be good metrics, but have other problems (in this case, the measure function may slow down simplify too much for very large expressions).  If you do not know what a good metric would be, the default, ``count_ops``, is a good one. For example: >>> from sympy import symbols, log >>> a, b = symbols('a b', positive=True) >>> g = log(a) + log(b) + log(a)*log(1/b) >>> h = simplify(g) >>> h log(a*b**(1 - log(a))) >>> count_ops(g) 8 >>> count_ops(h) 5 So you can see that ``h`` is simpler than ``g`` using the count_ops metric. However, we may not like how ``simplify`` (in this case, using ``logcombine``) has created the ``b**(log(1/a) + 1)`` term.  A simple way to reduce this would be to give more weight to powers as operations in ``count_ops``.  We can do this by using the ``visual=True`` option: >>> print(count_ops(g, visual=True)) 2*ADD + DIV + 4*LOG + MUL >>> print(count_ops(h, visual=True)) 2*LOG + MUL + POW + SUB >>> from sympy import Symbol, S >>> def my_measure(expr): ...     POW = Symbol('POW') ...     # Discourage powers by giving POW a weight of 10 ...     count = count_ops(expr, visual=True).subs(POW, 10) ...     # Every other operation gets a weight of 1 (the default) ...     count = count.replace(Symbol, type(S.One)) ...     return count >>> my_measure(g) 8 >>> my_measure(h) 14 >>> 15./8 > 1.7 # 1.7 is the default ratio True >>> simplify(g, measure=my_measure) -log(a)*log(b) + log(a) + log(b) Note that because ``simplify()`` internally tries many different simplification strategies and then compares them using the measure function, we get a completely different result that is still different from the input expression by doing this. If ``rational=True``, Floats will be recast as Rationals before simplification. If ``rational=None``, Floats will be recast as Rationals but the result will be recast as Floats. If rational=False(default) then nothing will be done to the Floats. If ``inverse=True``, it will be assumed that a composition of inverse functions, such as sin and asin, can be cancelled in any order. For example, ``asin(sin(x))`` will yield ``x`` without checking whether x belongs to the set where this relation is true. The default is False. Note that ``simplify()`` automatically calls ``doit()`` on the final expression. You can avoid this behavior by passing ``doit=False`` as an argument. Also, it should be noted that simplifying a boolean expression is not well defined. If the expression prefers automatic evaluation (such as :obj:`~.Eq()` or :obj:`~.Or()`), simplification will return ``True`` or ``False`` if truth value can be determined. If the expression is not evaluated by default (such as :obj:`~.Predicate()`), simplification will not reduce it and you should use :func:`~.refine` or :func:`~.ask` function. This inconsistency will be resolved in future version.
